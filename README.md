# Yet Another Keystrokes Overlay (YAKO)

**YAKO** is a design-focused keystrokes overlay for Minecraft 1.20.1 (Fabric).  
It shows your **WASD**, **mouse buttons**, **sneak**, **jump**, and **sprint** inputs — fully customizable to match your layout and visual preferences.

From rounded and transparent strokes to sound profiles and profile switching, YAKO is built with flexibility and user experience in mind.

## Features

- **Visual Keystrokes HUD**  
  Shows real-time feedback for WASD, LMB/RMB, Shift, Ctrl, and Space. You can customize the layout, look, and text for each key individually.

- **Customizable Layout**  
  Drag and resize each keystroke freely. Supports transparent strokes, outlines, rounded borders, and custom labels.

- **Interactive Mouse Controls**  
  Intuitive mouse-based interactions let you build or edit your layout without menus (see controls below).

- **Sound Feedback System**  
  Enable keystroke sounds for a tactile typing experience. Choose between `linear`, `tactile`, or `clicky` sound profiles. Volume and sound state can be adjusted per layout profile.

- **Profile System**  
  Save and switch between multiple keystroke layouts using the `/yako` command. Each profile stores strokes, layout, sound settings, and more.

- **Command-Based Customization**  
  Use the `/yako` command to manage layouts, toggle features, switch lettering and adjust sound settings.
